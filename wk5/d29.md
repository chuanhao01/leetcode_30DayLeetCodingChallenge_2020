# Day 29

Question:  
```
Given a non-empty binary tree, find the maximum path sum.

For this problem, a path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The path must contain at least one node and does not need to go through the root.
```

Example 1:  
```
Input: [1,2,3]

       1
      / \
     2   3

Output: 6
```

Example 2:  
```
Input: [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]

   -10
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7

Output: 42
```


Solution: 

So slight note for this solution, I had to search for some hints, as I realised I had to do a dfs and get the max of each sub tree and in the process came up with my first solution below.  

But I realised that there another way to approach the problem and dfs which could be less confusing, as such I decied to include both

```python3
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def maxPathSum(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        self.ans = -10^10
        def dfs(head):
            if head == None:
                return 0
            L = dfs(head.left)
            R = dfs(head.right)
            self.ans = max(self.ans, max(L, R, L+R, 0) + head.val)
            return head.val + max(L, R, 0)
        dfs(root)
        return self.ans
```

Explanation:  

So for this solution, we first consider that for we will consider the node at any point to be a root node.  
As such the maximum sum at that point would be either:  
- `root.val`
- `root.val + L` (Left)
- `root.val + R` (Right)
- `root.val + L + R` (Left and Right)
- Lastly it could one of the previous roots we considered already.

So the `self.ans` look like this, `max(self.ans, max(L, R, L+R, 0) + head.val)`.  

Then for returning the maximum path at that node, to consider it to be able to be used as a L or R for other path calculations, we would only be able to take one path (L or R), and or itself.  
As such the decision is:  
- `root.val`
- `root.val + L`
- `root.val + R`

Which is why we have a 0 to signify itself only.  

In this approach we consider that we will always have to take and return the root node we are at itself.  
But then we would have to consider all 4 cases when taking the maximum sum.  

I think this was personally more intuitive for me but the method below is more elegant.  

Time Complexity:  
O(N) We only ever call each node once  

Space Complexity:  
O(N) Largest call stack is the whole tree  

Other solution, with a slight different approach to DFS:  
```python3
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def maxPathSum(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        self.ans = -10^10
        def dfs(head):
            if head == None:
                return 0
            L = dfs(head.left)
            R = dfs(head.right)
            self.ans = max(self.ans, head.val + L + R)
            return max(0, head.val + max(L, R))
        dfs(root)
        return self.ans
```

Explaination:  
So for this, you would have to read the above solution for some context but borrowing the same idea.  
Notice that for the maximum sum of sub-trees, to be used by other roots,  
If the root.val > 0, we could either:  
- take it + `L`
- Or take it + `R`

Because either way, any of these 2 ways will give the maximum.  
But if the root.val < 0:  

- We would either take nothing (0)
- Take either path

Thus giving us max(0, head.val + max(L, R)).  

Then since if either path was ever going to give us a -value, we would already not consider it,  
For calculating the maxmium possible path at any root node, it would be:  
- any one of the previous ans
- `root.val + L + R` -> because maximum would always consider both sides, and any we don't consider are already 0  

Time Complexity:  
O(N) We only ever call each node once  

Space Complexity:  
O(N) Largest call stack is the whole tree
