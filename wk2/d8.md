# Day 8

Question:  
```
Given a non-empty, singly linked list with head node head, return a middle node of linked list.

If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.
```

Example 1:  
```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: Node 3 from this list (Serialization: [3,4,5])
The returned node has value 3.  (The judge's serialization of this node is [3,4,5]).
Note that we returned a ListNode object ans, such that:
ans.val = 3, ans.next.val = 4, ans.next.next.val = 5, and ans.next.next.next = NULL.
```

```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: Node 4 from this list (Serialization: [4,5,6])
Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.
```


Solution: 

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def middleNode(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        rtr_node = head
        counter = 0
        if(head.next == None):
            return head
        while(head.next != None):
            if(counter != 0 and counter%2==0):
                rtr_node = rtr_node.next
            head = head.next
            counter += 1
        return rtr_node.next
        
```

Explaination:  
We have 2 pointers, one moving at half the speed, return the pointer in the middle when we reach the end.  
I used the %2 strategy.  

Time Complexity:  
O(N) We iterate through each node only once.

Space Complexity:  
O(1) Because we will only ever use 2 pointers
