Question:  
```
Given two strings S and T, return if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. # means a backspace character.

Note that after backspacing an empty text, the text will continue empty.

Note:

1 <= S.length <= 200
1 <= T.length <= 200
S and T only contain lowercase letters and '#' characters.

Can you solve it in O(N) time and O(1) space
```

Example 1:  
```
Input: S = "ab#c", T = "ad#c"
Output: true
Explanation: Both S and T become "ac".
```

Example 2:
```
Input: S = "ab##", T = "c#d#"
Output: true
Explanation: Both S and T become "".
```

Example 3:  
```
Input: S = "a##c", T = "#a#c"
Output: true
Explanation: Both S and T become "c".
```

Example 4:  
```
Input: S = "a#c", T = "b"
Output: false
Explanation: S becomes "c" while T becomes "b".
```


Solution: 

My first python solution

```python
class Solution:
    def backspaceCompare(self, S: str, T: str) -> bool:
        s_stack = []
        t_stack = []
        for i in S:
            if(i == '#'):
                if(len(s_stack) != 0):
                    s_stack.pop(-1)
            else:
                s_stack.append(i)
        for i in T:
            if(i == '#'):
                if(len(t_stack) != 0):
                    t_stack.pop(-1)
            else:
                t_stack.append(i)
        return s_stack == t_stack
```

Explanation:  
I used 2 stacks to find out the final word at the end.

Time Complexity:  
O(N + M) one pass of both strings

Space Complexity:  
O(N + M) 2 stacks to keep track of both strings

My cpp solution based on the note of O(N) time and O(1) space.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool backspaceCompare(string S, string T) {
        int s_l = S.size(), t_l = T.size();
        int s_t = 0, t_t = 0;
        for(int i=0; i<max(s_l, t_l); i++){
            char s_c, t_c;
            if(i<s_l){
                s_c = S[i];
                if(s_c == '#'){
                    if(s_t > 0){
                        s_t--;
                    }
                }
                else{
                    S[s_t] = s_c;
                    s_t++;
                }
            }
            if(i<t_l){
                t_c = T[i];
                if(t_c == '#'){
                    if(t_t > 0){
                        t_t--;
                    }
                }
                else{
                    T[t_t] = t_c;
                    t_t++;
                }
            }
        }
        S.resize(s_t);
        T.resize(t_t);
        return S == T;
    }
};
```

Explaination:  
We loop through both strings at the same time, taking the limit to be the longer of the 2 strings.  
We also use a 2 pointer strategy to have a tracker and i.  
Then as we loop throught the strings, we check if the char at i is '#' or a char.  
If it '#' we move tracker pointer back by 1 if not at index 0.  
Else we set the current tracker char to the char we got and move tracker along.  

At the end we resize the strings to remove any empty space and compare the strings.  

Time Complexity:  
O(N) where N > M for the strings

Space Complexity:  
O(1)
