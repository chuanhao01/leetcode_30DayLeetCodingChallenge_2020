## Last Stone Weight

Question:  
```
We have a collection of stones, each stone has a positive integer weight.

Each turn, we choose the two heaviest stones and smash them together.
Suppose the stones have weights x and y with x <= y.  The result of this smash is:

- If x == y, both stones are totally destroyed;
- If x != y, the stone of weight x is totally destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y-x.
At the end, there is at most 1 stone left.  Return the weight of this stone (or 0 if there are no stones left.)

Note:

1. <= stones.length <= 30
2. <= stones[i] <= 1000
```

Example 1:  
```
Input: [2,7,4,1,8,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
We combine 7 and 8 to get 1 so the array converts to [2,4,1,1,1] then,
we combine 2 and 4 to get 2 so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then,
we combine 2 and 1 to get 1 so the array converts to [1,1,1] then,
we combine 1 and 1 to get 0 so the array converts to [1] then that's the value of last stone.
```


Solution: 
```cpp
ass Solution:
    def lastStoneWeight(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:
        if(stones == []):
            return 0
        elif(len(stones) == 1):
            return stones[0]
        stones.sort()
        while(len(stones) > 1):
            y = stones.pop()
            x = stones.pop()
            if(x == y):
                stones.append(0)
                stones.sort()
            else:
                stones.append(y - x)
                stones.sort()
        return stones[0]

```

Explaination:  
I used the naive method of sorting all the stones and taking the last 2 largest stones and smash them together.  
Not too sure what a binary heap is but I think the process is quite similar.

Time Complexity:  
O(N log N)? im not sure

Space Complexity:  
O(N) Cause the largest of the reserved size of the stones is N itself.
