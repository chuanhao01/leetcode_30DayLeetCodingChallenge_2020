## Diameter of Binary Tree

Question:  
```
Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.
```

Example 1:  
```
Given a binary tree
          1
         / \
        2   3
       / \     
      4   5 
Return 3, which is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].

Note: The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.
```

Solution: 

```python3
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def diameterOfBinaryTree(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        self.ans = 1
        def depth(node):
            if not node: return 0
            L = depth(node.left)
            R = depth(node.right)
            self.ans = max(self.ans, L+R+1)
            return max(L, R) + 1

        depth(root)
        return self.ans - 1
```

Explaination:  
We use recursion to find the max diameter of each subtree on the left and right.  
Then as the diameter is L+R+1 edges, we repeat this until we get back to the root.

Time Complexity:  
O(N) Visit every node once

Space Complexity:  
O(N)
