# Day 13

Question:  
```
Given a binary array, find the maximum length of a contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.
```

Example 1:  
```
Input: [0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: [0, 1] is the longest contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.
```

Example 2:  
```
Input: [0,1,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: [0, 1] (or [1, 0]) is a longest contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.
```

Solution: 

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findMaxLength(vector<int>& nums) {
        unordered_map<int, int> counts;
        counts[0] = -1;
        int count = 0, max_len = 0;
        const int length = nums.size();
        for(int i=0; i<length; i++){
            if(nums[i] == 0){
                count--;
            }
            else{
                count++;
            }
            if(counts.count(count) == 1){
                max_len = max(max_len, i - counts[count]);
            }
            else{
                counts[count] = i;
            }
        }
        return max_len;
    }
};
```

Explaination:  
We notice that if we set 0 to be a - count and 1 to be a + count, maximum contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1 is the longest distance of like values.  
Thus using a hashmap to keep track of the seend count values and their first index seen, we take the max distance every time we see it again.  

Time Complexity:  
O(N) at most a one pass

Space Complexity:  
O(N) at most a hashmap with N values
