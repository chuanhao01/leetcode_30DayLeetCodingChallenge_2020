# Day 25

## Jump game

Question:  
```
Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.

Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Determine if you are able to reach the last index.

Constraints: 
- 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4
- 0 <= nums[i][j] <= 10^5
```

Example 1:  
```
Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: true
Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
```

Example 2:  
```
Input: nums = [3,2,1,0,4]
Output: false
Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.
```


Solution: 

So this was my first implementation and solution, but there was a better one I did in C.

```cpp
ass Solution {
public:
    bool canJump(vector<int>& nums) {
        const int length = nums.size();
        vector<bool> checks(length, false);
        for(int i=0; i<length-1; i++){
            const int jumps = nums[i];
            for(int j=jumps+i; j > i; j--){
                if(j < length){
                    if(checks[j]){
                        break;
                    }
                    else{
                        checks[j] = true;
                    }
                }
            }
            if(i+1 < length){
                if(!checks[i+1]){
                    return false;
                }    
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```

Explaination:  
So for this, my first intuition was to use an arr to store the bool values on whether we can reach a certain index.  
So we iterate over the values in nums and for each value we set the possible indexes it can reach to true.  
And we do this backwards, starting at the very end and checking if we can reach that position already.  
Because if we could, we would not need to set anything else as to get there, we could have reached every other possible index.  
Then lastly we check if we can reach the next index to continue.  
Because we would have to be able to get there from our current index, which would have already set the next step to true.  

Example:  
```
[1, 1, 1]

When we look at nums[0]
we set from i til i+nums[0] to be true as I can reach the step I am on and the next few based on the count.
[f, f, f] -> [t, t, f]
And we can see here that we can step forward and repeat this again.

But if we had 
[0, 1, 1]

Our bool arr afterwards is:  
[t, f, f]
So we are not able to move forward.
```

Then at the end return the bool value of last index.

Time Complexity:  
O(N^2)? or O(2N) -> O(N) Im not sure

Space Complexity:  
O(N) for the bool arr

Greedy solution in linear time and constant space:   
In cpp:  
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canJump(vector<int>& nums) {
        const int length = nums.size();
        int last_jump = length-1;
        for(int i=length - 2; i>-1; i--){
            if(i + nums[i] >= last_jump){
                last_jump = i;
            }
        }
        return last_jump == 0;
    }
};
```

In C:
```c
bool canJump(int* nums, int numsSize){
    int last_int = numsSize - 1;
    for(int i=numsSize-2; i>-1; i--){
        if(i + nums[i] >= last_int){
            last_int = i;
        }
    }
    return last_int == 0;
}
```

Explaination:  

Well for this solution we are kinda borrowing the idea above, since all we care about is reaching the final index.  
We then check from the N-2 index ownwards, if the steps taken + i can reach the final index.  
If we can, then all we care about is if we can reach that index i.  
Now then can ever reach the index i from any other point, so if we can't we can skip that index and keep checking before.  

So at the end we just have to check what is the minimum index to reach the end.  
If it is 0, we can do it from the first index.  

Time Complexity:  
O(N) Linear time, single pass

Space Complexity:  
O(1) constant space
