# Day 26

Question:  
```
Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters(can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters. (eg, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not). A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

 

If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

Constraints:

- 1 <= text1.length <= 1000
- 1 <= text2.length <= 1000
- The input strings consist of lowercase English characters only.
```

So when I first approached this problems, there were hints given to use DP.  
Now I am quite new to using DP to solve problems, but I did try and find out what the state and moving from state was. (Not that i got it on my own :D).  

So in the end, it took me quite a while to think of a way to solve this.  
Although I did manage to realise that the text could be different lengths and that I would have to iterate through quite many of the combinations of the strings, so yea.  
(Big run time limit exceeded coming right up)

Example 1:  
```
Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
Output: 3  
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
```

Example 2:  
```
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.
```

Example 3:  
```
nput: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.
```


Solution: 

So here was the solution for the recursive way of solving this, big run time limit exceeded coming.
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestCommonSubsequence(string text1, string text2) {
        return lcs(text1, text2, text1.size(), text2.size());     
    }
    int lcs(string t1, string t2, int n, int m){
        if(n == 0 || m == 0){
            return 0;
        }
        if(t1[n-1] == t2[m-1]){
            return 1 + lcs(t1, t2, n-1, m-1);
        }
        else{
            return max(lcs(t1, t2, n-1, m), lcs(t1, t2, n, m-1));
        }
    }
};
```

Explaination:  
I don't think I can do the explaination justice, so let's try.  
This is essentially comapring the last 2 characters of the string and 2 things might happen.  

They are the same -> which case, `1 + LCS(n-1, m-1)` which is the 1(because of the common char) and the LCS of the strings without the last chars.  

They are not the same -> in which check the max(LCS(n, m-1), LCS(n-1, m)) find the max of the LCS of either sub-string.  

Now below is using memorization to store results to try and get the time complexity down.  

Recursive with memorization:  
```cpp

```
