# Day 27

Question:  
```
Given a 2D binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest square containing only 1's and return its area.
```

Example 1:  
```
Input: 

1 0 1 0 0
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 0

Output: 4
```


Solution: 

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maximalSquare(vector<vector<char>>& matrix) {
        if(matrix.size() == 0){
            return 0;
        }
        const int y = matrix.size(), x = matrix[0].size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(y + 1, vector<int>(x + 1, 0));
        int max_size = 0;
        for(int i=0; i<y; i++){
            for(int j=0; j<x; j++){
                int cur = matrix[i][j] - '0';
                if(cur == 0){
                    dp[i+1][j+1] = 0;
                }
                else{
                    dp[i+1][j+1] = cur + min(dp[i][j], min(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j+1]));
                }
                max_size = max(max_size, dp[i+1][j+1]);
            }
        }
        return max_size * max_size;
    }
};
```

Explaination:  
So this was again a recursive solution that uses DP to make it better.  
For the recursive solution, given  
```
10  11  11  
00  00  10  
``` 

One can see that the largest square here is 1 or 1 + min([i][j+1], [i+1][j], [i+1][j+1])
But if it was a sqaure of size 2,  
```
11 -> 11
11 -> 12
```

When calculating the 2, it is surrounded by 1's thus the min + 1 -> 2
So for any given 1 on the board, we can recursively use DFS to search and check the surrounding numbers.  

But how we use memorization to count the rest?  
We can see that when we calculate the recursive solution, we can just store past values.  
But then we can do one better with DP.  

We see that to get the next value, we need the values above.  
```
111
111    aa
111 -> a1
```

To find the bottom right number, we need the values of a.  
Thus we can use the bottom up approach from here.  

For any value `[i][j] == 1 -> 1 + min([i-1][j-1], [i-1][j], [i][j-1])`
And if its 0, we just don't consider it.  

Thus leading to the final solution, using an arr of y + 1 and x + 1 size,  
We can go top to bottom by row to calculate previous values and then keep track of the largest `dp[i][j]`  we have seen.  

Time Complexity:  
O(N * M) -> One pass through all the values

Space Complexity:  
O((N+1) * (M+1)) -> The size of the arr
