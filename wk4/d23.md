## Bitwise AND of Numbers Range

Now to be honest I don't get the solution for this, I did the normal way, which was to do a AND for every number but that didn't work.  
I also am not very sure about bitwise manipulation so this was all confusing to me.  

Question:  
```
Given a range [m, n] where 0 <= m <= n <= 2147483647, return the bitwise AND of all numbers in this range, inclusive.
```

Example 1:  
```
Input: [5,7]
Output: 4
```

Example 2:  
```
Input: [0,1]
Output: 0
```


Solution: 

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int rangeBitwiseAnd(int m, int n) {
        while(m < n){
            n -= (n & -n);
        }
        return n;
    }
};
```

Explaination:  
Something to do with efficient AND operations

Time Complexity:  
?

Space Complexity:  
O(1) constant
