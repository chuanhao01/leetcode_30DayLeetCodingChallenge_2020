## Subarray Sum Equals K

This was pretty hard as it was a step up from the normal target sum finding in a sub arr.  
But luckily I was able to just expand the conecpt of sum of c[i, j] = c[0, j] - c[0, i]  

Question:  
```
Given an array of integers and an integer k, you need to find the total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals to k.

Note:
1. The length of the array is in range [1, 20,000].
2. The range of numbers in the array is [-1000, 1000] and the range of the integer k is [-1e7, 1e7].
```

Example 1:  
```
Input:nums = [1,1,1], k = 2
Output: 2
```

Solution: 

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int subarraySum(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        const int length = nums.size();
        vector<int> sums_v(length + 1, 0);
        unordered_map <int, vector<int>> sums_map;
        int sum = 0;
        for(int i=0; i<length; i++){
            sum += nums[i];
            sums_v[i+1] = sum;
            sums_map[sum].push_back(i+1);
        }
        int sub_arrs = 0;
        for(int i=0; i<length; i++){
            int b = sums_v[i] + k;
            if(sums_map.count(b)){
                vector<int> is_v = sums_map[b];
                for(int is : is_v){
                    if(i+1 <= is){
                        sub_arrs++;
                    }
                }   
            }
        }
        return sub_arrs;
    }
};
```

Explaination:  

So for this, we should notice the property that if we have an arr of `N+1` size,  
With `a[0] -> 0`.  
Then we can store cumulative sums as:  
From `a[n] = sum of 0 to index n-1`  
So `a[1]` is the sum up till index 0  
And to find the sub arr from index `j` to `i` we can take the arr[j+1] - arr[i+1]  
Then for just the sub arr up till `i`, arr[i+1] - arr[0]  

So for our solution, we use the formula that at a given sum in `sums`.  
`sum[j] - sums[i] = k`  given index+1  
Then for each `sums[j]`  
We can calculate the only corrosponding `sums[i]` to make k  
Therefore using a hashmap to store the other sums, and their index we can then count the possible sums to get k for every sum in `sums`.  

For this we can also use the hashmap to store counts of each sum which is probaly better.  
Just as a side note.  

Time Complexity:  
O(N) > cause of the nested loop? im not sure

Space Complexity:  
O(2N) -> O(N) because of hashmap and sums arr
