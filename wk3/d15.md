## Product of Array Except Self

Question:  
```
Given an array nums of n integers where n > 1,  return an array output such that output[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

Constraint: It's guaranteed that the product of the elements of any prefix or suffix of the array (including the whole array) fits in a 32 bit integer.  

Note: Please solve it without division and in O(n).

Follow up:
Could you solve it with constant space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for the purpose of space complexity analysis.)
```

Example 1:  
```
Input:  [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]

```


Solution: 

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> productExceptSelf(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<int> prod_nums(nums.size());
        int current_prod = 1;
        for(int i=0; i<nums.size(); i++){
            prod_nums[i] = current_prod;
            current_prod *= nums[i];
        }
        current_prod = 1;
        for(int i=nums.size()-1; i>-1; i--){
            prod_nums[i] *= current_prod;
            current_prod *= nums[i];
        }
        return prod_nums;
    }
};
```

Explaination:  
Thinking through it, as you pass through the arr, you get the product of all the number before the current num.  
Thus using 2 passes, 0 -> n-1 and n-1 -> 0  
We can get the product of all nums except the index itself.  
As since we are using the result arr to store the products, it is constant space.

Time Complexity:  
O(2N) -> O(N)

Space Complexity:  
O(1)
