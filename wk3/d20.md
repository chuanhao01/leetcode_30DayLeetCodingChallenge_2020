## Construct Binary Search Tree from Preorder Traversal

To be honest, for this question, I did my solution thinking it would not work and bam it was accepted so woo!

Question:  
```
Return the root node of a binary search tree that matches the given preorder traversal.

(Recall that a binary search tree is a binary tree where for every node, any descendant of node.left has a value < node.val, and any descendant of node.right has a value > node.val.  Also recall that a preorder traversal displays the value of the node first, then traverses node.left, then traverses node.right.)

It's guaranteed that for the given test cases there is always possible to find a binary search tree with the given requirements.

Constraints:

1. 1 <= preorder.length <= 100
2. 1 <= preorder[i] <= 10^8
3. The values of preorder are distinct.

```

Example 1:  
```
          8
         / \
        5   10
       / \   \
      1   7   12
Input: [8,5,1,7,10,12]
Output: [8,5,10,1,7,null,12]

```

Solution:  

```python3
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def bstFromPreorder(self, preorder: List[int]) -> TreeNode:
        head = TreeNode(preorder.pop(0))
        for i in preorder:
            down = TreeNode(i)
            self.findEnd(head, down)
        return head
    
    def findEnd(self, body, down):
        if(body.val > down.val and body.left == None):
            body.left = down
            return
        if(body.val < down.val and body.right == None):
            body.right = down
            return
        if(body.val > down.val):
            self.findEnd(body.left, down)
        else:
            self.findEnd(body.right, down)
```

Explaination:  

So for my solution, I took the first element as the root node.  
Then for each subsequent node, if I had read the end left/right node of the root, then I would make a new mode and place it there.  

But if there were more nodes on the left or right, the comparing the values, run the findEnd function again with the corrosponding node (left or right) as the root node until the first situation again and place it.  

Time Complexity:  
?

Space Complexity:  
? I don't know how to calculate this for these questions
