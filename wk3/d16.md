## Valid Parenthesis String

Note I know there is a way of linear time and constant space, but I don't really understand it.

Question:  
```
Given a string containing only three types of characters: '(', ')' and '*', write a function to check whether this string is valid. We define the validity of a string by these rules:

1. Any left parenthesis '(' must have a corresponding right parenthesis ')'.
2. Any right parenthesis ')' must have a corresponding left parenthesis '('.
3. Left parenthesis '(' must go before the corresponding right parenthesis ')'.
4. '*' could be treated as a single right parenthesis ')' or a single left parenthesis '(' or an empty string.
5. An empty string is also valid.

Note:
1. The string size will be in the range [1, 100].
```

Example 1:  
```
Input: "()"
Output: True
```

Example 2:  
```
Input: "(*)"
Output: True
```

Example 3:  
```
Input: "(*))"
Output: True
```

Solution: 

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool checkValidString(string s) {
        stack<int> c_s, a_s;
        for(int i=0; i<s.size(); i++){
            char c = s[i];
            if(c == '('){
                c_s.push(i);
            }
            else if(c == ')'){
                if(!c_s.empty()){
                    c_s.pop();
                }
                else{
                    if(!a_s.empty()){
                        a_s.pop();
                    }
                    else{
                        return false;
                    }
                }
            }
            else{
                a_s.push(i);
            }
        }
        if(!c_s.empty()){
            while(!c_s.empty()){
                int c = c_s.top();
                int a;
                if(!a_s.empty()){
                    a = a_s.top();
                    a_s.pop();
                }
                else{
                    return false;
                }
                if(a > c){
                    c_s.pop();
                }
            }
            return true;
        }
        else{
            return true;
        }
    }
};
```

Explaination:  
So for this problem, I was quite stuck as I approached it using the normal 1 stack solution I used when solving problems of this nature.  

Such as checking if parenthesis are complete or other problems pertaining to parenthesis.  

But after thinking about it for a while, as my solution using 1 stack kept giving me errors, mainly as I did not care about the order and placement of the *, using * as wildcards whenever I would originally run into problems.  

This was not a really good solution.  

Eventually I figured out, as this was only dealing with '(' parenthesis, and that using 2 stacks would still be O(N) space, what's better than 1 stack? 2 stacks, that right.  

So using 2 stacks to keep track of the index of '(' and '*', and using the normal one pass of elimiating any '(' seen with ')' and extra ')' with '*' I would be left with 2 stacks of '(' and '*' positions.  

Then I would iterate through them, checking if the '*' was on the right side of the '(' then I would be able to close it.  

Time Complexity:  
O(N)? im not sure

Space Complexity:  
O(N) -> because max stack is O(N) size combined
