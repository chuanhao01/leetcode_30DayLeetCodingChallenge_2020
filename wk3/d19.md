## Search in Rotated Sorted Array

Now to be honest for this, I am still not very clear on the solution, using binary search, I get how it works, but the implementation flies over my head.  
Especially dealing with odd/even elements in between and the int rounding down.

Question:  
```
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).
```

Example 1:  
```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
```

Example 2:  
```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
```
Solution: 

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        if(nums.size() == 0){
            return -1;
        }
        int left = 0, right = nums.size()-1;
        while(left < right){
            int midpoint = left + (int) ((right - left) / 2);
            if(nums[midpoint] > nums[right]){
                left = midpoint + 1;
            }
            else{
                right = midpoint;
            }
        }
        int start = left;
        left = 0, right = nums.size()-1;
        if(nums[start] <= target && target <= nums[right]){
//             if on the left side
            left = start;
        }
        else{
            right = start;
        }
        
        while(left <= right){
            int midpoint = left + (int) ((right - left) / 2);
            if(nums[midpoint] == target){
                return midpoint;
            }
            else{
                if(nums[midpoint] < target){
                    left = midpoint+1;
                }
                else{
                    right = midpoint-1;
                }
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
```

Explaination:  
Using a modified binary search, we find the pivot point in left.  
Then we use a binary search considering where the target is in the left or right sub arrs.  

Time Complexity:  
O(log N)? i guess

Space Complexity:  
O(1) Constant space cause vars
