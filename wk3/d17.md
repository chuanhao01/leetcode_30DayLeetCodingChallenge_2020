## Number of Islands

Question:  
```
Given a 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.
```

Example 1:  
```
Input:
11110
11010
11000
00000

Output: 1
```

Example 2:  
```
Input:
11000
11000
00100
00011

Output: 3
```


Solution: 

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numIslands(vector<vector<char>>& grid) {
        int islands = 0;
        if(grid.size() == 0){
            return 0;
        }
        const int max_y = grid.size(), max_x = grid[0].size();
        for(int y=0; y<max_y; y++){
            for(int x=0; x<max_x; x++){
                if(grid[y][x] == '1'){
                    islands++;
                    findIsland(grid, y, x);
                }
            }
        }
        return islands;
    }
private:
    void findIsland(vector<vector<char>>& grid, const int y, const int x){
        const int max_y = grid.size(), max_x = grid[0].size();
        if(y < 0 || x < 0 || y >= max_y || x >= max_x || grid[y][x] == '0'){
            return;
        }
        grid[y][x] = '0';
        vector<int> changes = {-1, 1};
        for(int i=0; i<2; i++){
            findIsland(grid, y + changes[i], x);
            findIsland(grid, y, x + changes[i]);
        }
    }
};
```

Explaination:  
For this solution, we used a DFS to flip the 1 of islands to 0 when we find the start of an island and count the island as a whole.  

This way, as we go through the whole grid, any new 1's we find would be a new island to count and we know the rest of the island would not be counted again.  

Time Complexity:  
O(N*N)? Im not sure

Space Complexity:  
? I also do not know
