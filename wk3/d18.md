# Day 18

Question:  
```
Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

Note: You can only move either down or right at any point in time.
```

Example 1:  
```
Input:
[
  [1,3,1],
  [1,5,1],
  [4,2,1]
]
Output: 7
Explanation: Because the path 1→3→1→1→1 minimizes the sum.
```


Solution: 

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minPathSum(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        if(grid.size() == 0 || grid.empty()){
            return 0;
        }
        const int max_y = grid.size(), max_x = grid[0].size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(max_y, vector<int>(max_x));
        for(int y=0; y<max_y; y++){
            for(int x=0; x<max_x; x++){
                dp[y][x] = grid[y][x];
                if(y == 0 && x== 0){
                    continue;           
                }
                else if(y == 0){
                    // top row
                    dp[y][x] += dp[y][x-1];
                }
                else if(x == 0){
                    // column
                    dp[y][x] += dp[y-1][x];
                }
                else{
                    dp[y][x] += min(dp[y][x-1], dp[y-1][x]);
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[max_y-1][max_x-1];
    }
};
```

Explaination:  
This uses a DP solution, my first one that I wrote I think.  
So we go off the fact that to get to position `i,j` we can only get there only from the top and left, `i-1,j` and `i,j-1`  
So to minimise the sum of the path, as long as we are not on the top row, or left column, we just take:  
`dp[i][j] = grid[i][j] + min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])`

So for this, we just have to do a one pass of the grid to calculate all dp values and return dp[n-1][m-1]
