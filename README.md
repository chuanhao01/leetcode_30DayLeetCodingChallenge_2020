# leetcode_30daychallenege2020

This was my solutions and attempts for this year's new leetcode 30 day challenge amid the coiv-19 situation happening around the world at this moment.  

I decided that I wanted to try out this challenge even though I had not done anything similiar to this before.  
Previously, I had mostly only done development work as you can see based on the repos I have and I had only, very recently tried out things like trying to learn CS or doing things like leet code questions.  

As such, after being encouraged by a friend to do more of this style of programming, dealing mostly with data structures and algorithms, I decided why not do somthing like this and learn what I can.  

So in this repo, you will see me try (and sometimes fail) at some of these questions, will trying my best to explain the solutions and adding in some of my thought process.  

Hopefully if anyone reads this, I hope it helps you :D.
