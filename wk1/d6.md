## Group Anagrams

Question:  
```
Given an array of strings, group anagrams together.
```

Example 1:  
```
Input: ["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"],
Output:
[
  ["ate","eat","tea"],
  ["nat","tan"],
  ["bat"]
]
```


Solution: 

```python3
class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        hashmap = {}
        for i in strs:
            sorted_str = ''.join(sorted(i))
            if sorted_str in hashmap:
                hashmap[sorted_str].append(i)
            else:
                hashmap[sorted_str] = [i]
        return hashmap.values()               
```

Explaination:  
Using python sort function, we can sort each string and them using that as a key in a hashmap to group the strings.

(From leetcode cause idk the time complexity)
Time Complexity:  
O(NK \log K)O(NKlogK), where NN is the length of strs, and KK is the maximum length of a string in str.  
The outer loop has complexity O(N)O(N) as we iterate through each string.  
Then, we sort each string in O(K \log K)O(KlogK) time.  

Space Complexity:  
O(N K)
