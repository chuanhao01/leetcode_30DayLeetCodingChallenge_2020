# Day 4

Question:  
```
Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Note:

1. You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
2. Minimize the total number of operations.
```

Example 1:  
```
Input: [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
```


Solution: 

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void moveZeroes(vector<int>& nums) {
        const int length = nums.size();
        int cur = 0;
        for(int i=0; i<length; i++){
            if(nums[i] != 0){
                nums[cur] = nums[i];
                cur++;
            }
        }
        for(; cur<length; cur++){
            nums[cur] = 0;
        }
        return;
    }
};
```

Explaination:  
We use 2 pointers, one keeping track of where we are in the arr and the other looping through the whole arr.  
When we find a 0, we keep a count on it and move on, and if it is not a 0, we move it to where the 1st pointer is, then move the pointer.  

Time Complexity:  
O(N)

Space Complexity:  
O(1)
