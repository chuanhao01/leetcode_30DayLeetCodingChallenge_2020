# Day num

Question: 
```
Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Note:

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?
```

Example 1
```
Input: [2,2,1]
Output: 1
```

Example 2
```
Input: [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
```


Solution: 

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    // using hashmap to store counts, then return num with counts 1
    int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        unordered_map<int, int> counts;
        for(int i: nums){
            if(counts.count(i) == 1){
                counts[i]++;
            }
            else{
                counts[i] = 1;
            }
        }
        for(pair<int, int> i: counts){
            if(i.second == 1){
                return i.first;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
```

Explaination:
Using a hashmap to store counts of the elements.
Then looping through again to check if counts is 1.

Time complexity:
O(2N) -> O(N)

Space complexity:
O(N)
