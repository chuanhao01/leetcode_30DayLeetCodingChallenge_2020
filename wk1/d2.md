# Day 2

Question: 
```
Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

Return True if n is a happy number, and False if not.
```

Example 1:
```
Input: 19
Output: true
Explanation: 
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1
```



Solution: 

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isHappy(int n) {
        unordered_set<int> check_nums;
        while(n != 1){
            check_nums.insert(n);
            n = getNextNum(n);
            if(check_nums.count(n) == 1){
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
    int getNextNum(int n){
        int sum = 0;
        while(n){
            int digit = n%10;
            sum += digit*digit;
            n /= 10;
        }
        return sum;
    }
};
```

Explaination:
We use a hashset/unordered set to keep track of past seen nums.
Then we have a help function to get the next number based on the algo.

Not so sure about the time complexity, but I think its O(N) because we only go through the number we have to check once.

Time Complexity:
O(N)?

Space Complexity:
O(N) => Because of the hashset
